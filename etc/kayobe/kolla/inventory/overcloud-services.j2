# This inventory section provides a mapping of services to components.
#
# Top level groups define the roles of hosts, e.g. controller or compute.
# Components define groups of services, e.g. nova or ironic.
# Services define single containers, e.g. nova-compute or ironic-api.

# Additional control implemented here. These groups allow you to control which
# services run on which hosts at a per-service level.
#
# Word of caution: Some services are required to run on the same host to
# function appropriately. For example, neutron-metadata-agent must run on the
# same host as the l3-agent and (depending on configuration) the dhcp-agent.
